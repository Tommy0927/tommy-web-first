<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/"target="_blank">Many new college students view the college years</a> as a chance to start over,
(to be/ being) who they really are, and to escape
the perceptions other students had about them
in high school.</p><p>
This is true., However, this thought process
leads some students to try changing
themselves to impress others.</p><p>
The best piece of advice you have received
from family and friends (is/ are/ being)
to be yourself.</p>
<img src = "ADA" width="30%"><p>
Your efforts to be someone other than other
than your true self will fail.</p><p>
In the meantime, other students who recognize
your dishonesty will be reluctant to befriend you.</p><p>
Soon you will feel out of place out of place
and under pressure to maintain the (true/ false) identity.</p><p>
If you act naturally and allow yourself
to make mistakes, you will find genuine
friends and a place for yourself within the
 first month or two of college.</p>
